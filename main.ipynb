      "PURPOSE: Appropriate opioid management is crucial to reduce opioid overdose risk \n",
      "for ICU surgical patients, which can lead to severe complications. Accurately \n",
      "predicting postoperative opioid needs and understanding the associated factors \n",
      "can effectively guide appropriate opioid use, significantly enhancing patient \n",
      "safety and recovery outcomes. Although machine learning models can accurately \n",
      "predict postoperative opioid needs, lacking interpretability hinders their \n",
      "adoption in clinical practice.\n",
      "METHODS: We developed an interpretable deep learning framework to evaluate \n",
      "individual feature's impact on postoperative opioid use and identify important \n",
      "factors. A Permutation Feature Importance Test (PermFIT) was employed to assess \n",
      "the impact with a rigorous statistical inference for machine learning models \n",
      "including Support Vector Machines, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and \n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation \n",
      "Coefficient (PCC) were used to evaluate the performance of these models.\n",
      "RESULTS: We conducted analysis utilizing the electronic health records of 4,912 \n",
      "surgical patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. \n",
      "In a 10-fold cross-validation, the DNN outperformed other machine learning \n",
      "models, achieving the lowest MSE (7889.2 mcg) and highest PCC (0.283). Among 25 \n",
      "features, 13-including age, surgery type, and others-were identified as \n",
      "significant predictors of postoperative opioid use (p < 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The DNN proved to be an effective model for predicting postoperative \n",
      "opioid consumption and identifying significant features through the PermFIT \n",
      "framework. This approach offers a valuable tool for precise opioid prescription \n",

      "materials (PEMs) and identifies predictive factors for successful text \n",
      "transformation.\n",
      "METHODS: We transformed 48 orthopaedic PEMs using GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2, and \n",
      "Llama 2. The readability, quantified by the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease (FKRE) \n",

      "RESULTS: All LLMs improved FKRE and FKGL scores (p < 0.01). GPT-4 showed \n",
      "superior performance, transforming PEMs to a seventh-grade reading level (mean \n",

      "Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health issue, necessitating \n",
      "innovative methodologies to improve early detection and diagnosis. Despite the \n",
      "existence of intelligent deep learning models, their efficacy is often limited \n",
      "due to the oversight of small-sized masses, leading to false positive and false \n",
      "negative outcomes. This research introduces a novel segmentation-guided \n",
      "classification model developed to increase BC detection accuracy. The designed \n",
      "model unfolds in two critical phases, each contributing to a comprehensive BC \n",
      "diagnostic pipeline. In Phase I, the Attention U-Net model is utilized for BC \n",
      "segmentation. The encoder extracts hierarchical features, while the decoder, \n",
      "supported by attention mechanisms, refines the segmentation, focusing on \n",
      "suspicious regions. In Phase II, a novel ensemble approach is introduced for BC \n",
      "classification, involving various feature extraction methods, base classifiers, \n",
      "and a meta-classifier. An ensemble of model classifiers-including support vector \n",
      "machine, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network- \n",
      "captures diverse patterns within these features. The Random Forest \n",
      "meta-classifier amalgamates their outputs, leveraging their collective \n",
      "strengths. The proposed integrated model accurately identifies different breast \n",
      "tumor classes, including malignant, benign, and normal. The precise \n",
      "region-of-interest analysis from segmentation phase significantly boosted \n",
