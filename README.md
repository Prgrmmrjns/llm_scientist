# Systematic Review with LLMs

## Overview
This framework automates systematic reviews by:
1. Collecting user input like topic, journals, and date range.
2. Querying multiple literature databases with LLM-generated or traditional keyword-based searches.
3. Assisting in study selection using LLM-based relevance scoring.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the main script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
3. View the results in your console or export them for further analysis.
