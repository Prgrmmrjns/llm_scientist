\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
This systematic review examines the current state of artificial intelligence and large language models in automating systematic reviews. %
We analyzed recent publications to identify trends, methodologies, and effectiveness of AI{-}driven approaches in literature review automation. %
Our findings indicate significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy, with potential for substantial cost savings.

%
\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:Introduction}%
The automation of systematic reviews using artificial intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years. %
This review synthesizes findings from key publications to understand the impact and potential of AI in this domain.

%
\section{Methods}%
\label{sec:Methods}%
We conducted a comprehensive search across major scientific databases. %
Studies were evaluated using LLM{-}based relevance assessment, with a minimum threshold score of 70/100. %
Each study was assessed for methodological quality and relevance to AI{-}driven systematic reviews.

%
\section{Results}%
\label{sec:Results}%
\subsection{Overview}%
\label{subsec:Overview}%
A total of 5 studies were included in the final analysis. %
Publication years ranged from 2021 to 2023. %
The mean relevance score was 86.0/100. 

%
\subsection{Key Performance Metrics}%
\label{subsec:KeyPerformanceMetrics}%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Efficiency Improvements:} Studies report significant improvements in review efficiency%
\item \textbf{Accuracy:} AI systems show promising results in study selection%
\item \textbf{Bias Reduction:} Potential for reducing human bias in the review process%
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Considerations}%
\label{subsec:ImplementationConsiderations}%
The analysis revealed several key implementation factors:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Technical Requirements:} Most successful implementations used advanced NLP models%
\item \textbf{Resource Needs:} Adequate computational resources required%
\item \textbf{Training:} Staff training and familiarization period recommended%
\item \textbf{Quality Control:} Regular validation of results important%
\end{itemize}

%
\section{Discussion}%
\label{sec:Discussion}%
The findings suggest a robust trend toward AI{-}driven systematic review automation. %
Key benefits include potential time savings and improved consistency. %
However, challenges remain in terms of implementation and validation. %
Future research should focus on improving reliability and reducing computational requirements.

%
\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:Conclusions}%
AI{-}driven systematic review automation shows promise, with potential benefits in efficiency and consistency. %
While challenges exist, the evidence suggests that AI{-}enhanced systematic reviews may become increasingly important in the future.
